# WindowsTouchCMD

I'm hoping to learn how to use Linux soon, so I've been trying to get used to the command line on my Windows computer. In class today, I was trying to make a file using Windows cmd, but I couldn't find anything about a basic Windows command to do this. I did, however, learn about the touch command on UNIX/Linux systems. I made this C++ file as a means of implementing a basic touch-like command for creating files on Windows systems. I probably could've used someone else's code, but I found doing the research and coding myself more educational and far more rewarding.
